# Project Description
Alzheimer’s Disease is one of the most common forms of dementia. Affecting over 7 million people in the United States, this disease can affect a person’s ability to remember things or carry out daily activities. This project aims to develop a web application that can assist users in determining if they might be at risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and if they should be checked based on data collected from the CDC.
